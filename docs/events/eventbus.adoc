At the heart of _{product-title}_ lies an *event bus*.
Any _{product-title}_ component can _publish_ events to the bus, and any component can _subscribe_ to receive events of interest that have been published on the bus.
This publish-subscribe model enables components to use events as a mechanism to send messages to each other.
For example, the provisioning subsystem of _{product-title}_ publishes a _node-added_ event whenever a new node is added to the system.
Other subsystems with an interest in new nodes subscribe to the _node-added_ event and automatically receive these events, so they know to start monitoring and managing the new node if their configuration dictates.
The publisher and subscriber components do not need to have any knowledge of each other, allowing for a clean division of labor and lessening the programming burden to add entirely new _{product-title}_ subsystems or modify the behavior of existing ones.
